# Software-Dev-1-Project
This is a project I made for my Sophmore year Software Development 1 class in 2020.  
There were no instruction on what to make. We all made proprosals for what we wanted to do. I have an interest in games so I decided to make Connect4.  
There are many things that I would change in this project but I would like to use this project to showcase my programming skill progression and my ability to learn.
